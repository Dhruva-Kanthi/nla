        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
We’re a group of high school students who saw two problems at
once. Local small businesses needed extra hands and fresh
ideas, and our classmates were hunting for real-world
experience that is very hard to find in high school. So we
built a nonprofit that tackles both.

Questions, ideas, or just curious about what we do? Email us at nextlineadvisory@gmail.com. Tell us a little about yourself—whether you’re a small-business owner looking for extra help or a student searching for hands-on experience—and we’ll point you in the right direction.<br><br>
We’re based in Frisco, Texas, but you don’t have to be. If you’re outside our hometown and want to get involved, reach out anyway; many of our projects can be handled remotely or adapted to other communities.<br><br>
We answer every message, usually within two school days. If you’d like a call, add your phone number to the email and let us know the best time to reach you. We look forward to hearing from you.
