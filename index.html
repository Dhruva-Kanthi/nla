      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>

We’re a group of high school students who saw two problems at once.
Local small businesses needed extra hands and fresh ideas, and our
classmates were hunting for real-world experience that is very hard
to find in high school. So we built a nonprofit that tackles both.

Our team pairs student volunteers with neighborhood shops, cafés,
start-ups, and family-run services. Students get on-the-ground
projects in marketing, finance, tech, or whatever the business
needs. Owners get motivated help they wouldn’t otherwise afford.
Everyone wins: businesses grow, students learn, and our community
becomes a little stronger.

If you’re a student ready to trade textbook theory for hands-on
work, or a business owner who could use extra brainpower, let’s
talk. We’re here to learn, help, and prove that high schoolers
can drive real change.
